## Vision Statement

<ins>Spenditure is a personal finance tool that will allow users to track, record, and analyze their financial transactions.<ins> Unlike a banking app, Spenditure is focused on helping users track where their money goes and better understand their spending habits.

It is easy to feel overwhelmed when it comes to finances, that’s why the vision of Spenditure is to provide users with a system that has an approachable learning curve and all the necessary tools to reach their financial goals. Due to our adaptable design, Spenditure proves invaluable for both novices embarking on their financial journey as well as seasoned veterans seeking a deeper insight into their finances.

To better support users' financial goals, Spenditure will allow users to permanently store both transactional data as well as images of receipts all in one place. These important details will allow the application to provide insightful analytics and sorting features.

Because this system will be dealing with users' sensitive financial information, Spenditure considers security to be an utmost priority. Users will be required to authenticate each device they’d like to use Spenditure on, but will only have to log in once per device; preserving user privacy while still being accessible on the go. All users will be able to manage their own data but will not be able to view information entered by other users.

Spenditure is intended to primarily be used on-the-go in order to emphasize accessibility and allow users to make quick updates as they make purchases. While it is not the most common use case, Spenditure will be accessible on desktop computers as well.

Spenditure will be an improvement over the other options on the market by being focused entirely on budgeting and by providing an easy-to-use interface intuitive to the average user. Other similar applications either have a barebones budgeting system tacked onto other primary functionalities or tricky interfaces that take many button presses to get anything done. Comparatively, Expenditure only requires a few button presses to get things done and provides customizable reporting features to help users better understand their spending habits. This increased functionality will allow users to save time previously spent fighting complex menus, access critical spending information quickly, and make more informed financial decisions. The system will remain profitable by displaying advertisements to free users or by having premium users pay a one-time fee to have uninterrupted access to the application’s features.

Spenditure will be considered a success if a majority of users, measured by survey results, agree that it is easier to use than alternatives and provides better analytical tools. Additionally, to uphold the goal of accessible on-the-go use, our application should allow users to manage transactions, view spending categories, and generate a simple report in 10 clicks.
