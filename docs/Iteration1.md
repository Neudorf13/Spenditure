# Iteration 1

## Features:

* Transaction Controller

* Category Handler

* Report Manager

## User Stories:

### Completed:


* Permanently save details of transactions
* Edit/remove transaction data
* Search transactions based on different criteria
* Organize Transactions

* Create categories for different types of expenses
* Organize transactions into categories

* View Spending Summary
* Customize Spending Summary

### Not complete:
* UI for Category Handler and Report Manager

We underestimated the time to get used to how UI works in AndroidStudio. We were focusing on developing UI for creating a Transaction form and UI for listing out all transactions to get it done by iteration 1. We decided to move the UI of the Report manager & Category Handler to iteration 2, since with UI for the transaction handler, we can re-use helpful components from the transaction handler's UI.



## *Architecture*
The architecture for iteration 1 can be found [here](./docs/Architecture_Diagram_Iteration1.pdf).

## Next Iteration

### For the second Iteration we plan to incorporate the following features:

* Time-based report manager
    - provides weekly and monthly summaries to users on their spending habits

* Upload receipt images to transactions
    - allows users to attach and save images of receipts to their transactions

* User account management
    - allows users to create and login to personal accounts

* Financial goal tracker
    - allows users to set and manage financial goals
