## Vision Statement

Spenditure is a personal finance tool that will allow users to track, record, and analyze their financial transactions. Unlike a banking app, Spenditure is focused on helping users track where their money goes and better understand their spending habits.

It is easy to feel overwhelmed when it comes to finances, that’s why the vision of Spenditure is to provide users with a system that has an approachable learning curve and all the necessary tools to reach their financial goals. Due to our adaptable design, Spenditure proves invaluable for both novices embarking on their financial journey as well as seasoned veterans seeking a deeper insight into their finances.

To better support users' financial goals, Spenditure will allow users to permanently store both transactional data as well as images of receipts all in one place. These important details will allow the application to provide insightful analytics and sorting features.

Because this system will be dealing with users' sensitive financial information, Spenditure considers security to be an utmost priority. Users will be required to authenticate each device they’d like to use Spenditure on, but will only have to log in once per device; preserving user privacy while still being accessible on the go. All users will be able to manage their own data but will not be able to view information entered by other users.

Spenditure is intended to primarily be used on mobile devices in order to emphasize accessibility and allow users to make quick updates as they make purchases. While it is not the most common use case, Spenditure will have a companion website so it can be used on desktop devices as well.

Spenditure will be an improvement over the other options on the market by being focused entirely on budgeting and by providing an easy-to-use interface intuitive to the average user. Other similar applications either have a barebones budgeting system tacked onto other primary functionalities or tricky interfaces that take many button presses to get anything done. Comparatively, Expenditure only requires a few button presses to get things done and provides customizable reporting features to help users better understand their spending habits. This increased functionality will allow users to save time previously spent fighting complex menus, access critical spending information quickly, and make more informed financial decisions. The system will remain profitable by displaying advertisements to free users or by having premium users pay a one-time fee to have uninterrupted access to the application’s features.

Spenditure will be considered a success if a majority of users, measured by survey results, agree that it is easier to use than alternatives and provides better analytical tools. Additionally, to uphold the goal of accessible on-the-go use, our application should allow users to manage transactions, view spending categories, and generate a simple report in 5 clicks-ish.

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thanks to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
